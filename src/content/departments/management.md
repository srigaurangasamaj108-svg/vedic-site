# The Vision
Modern management focuses on "Human Resource," treating people as fuel for profit. Vedic Management focuses on "Human Potential," aligning work with individual Dharma.

### Key Principles
1.  **Rajarshi Leadership:** The leader must first conquer their own mind before ruling others.
2.  **Loka-sangraha:** All actions must benefit the social order, not just the shareholder.
3.  **Yajna Spirit:** Work is an offering, not a transaction.
