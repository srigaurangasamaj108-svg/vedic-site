# The Crisis
Modern relationships are transactional ("What do I get?"). Vedic relationships are foundational ("Who do I serve?"). When the *Gṛhastha Āśrama* (Household) is strong, society is stable.

### Core Areas of Focus
1.  **Dāmpatya-jīvana:** Moving from "Contract" to "Covenant."
2.  **Garbha-Vijñāna:** Pre-natal education and conscious conception.
3.  **Vṛddha-sevā:** Honoring elders not as burdens, but as wisdom-keepers.
