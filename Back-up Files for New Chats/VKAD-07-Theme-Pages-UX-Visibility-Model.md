VKAD-07: THEME PAGES UX & VISIBILITY MODEL
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines:
* How theme pages are presented to users
* How thematic connections are revealed
* How much context is shown (and how much is hidden)
* How to avoid cognitive overload
* How to keep reading primary and discovery secondary
Its core purpose is to ensure that:
Themes guide without distracting,and reveal without overwhelming.

1. FUNDAMENTAL UX PRINCIPLE
Themes must feel like quiet signposts, not alternative entrances.
A user should never feel:
* “I am leaving the scripture”
* “I am entering a different system”
* “I must explore everything now”
Themes exist to extend understanding, not replace reading.

2. THE ROLE OF A THEME PAGE (VERY IMPORTANT)
A Theme Page is:
* a curated map
* a contextual index
* a cross-text guide
A Theme Page is not:
* an article
* an essay
* a lesson
* a replacement for śāstra

3. THEME PAGE STRUCTURE (CANONICAL)
Every Theme Page must follow this structure exactly.
3.1 Header Section (Quiet Orientation)
Includes:
* Theme name (simple, dignified)
* One-line neutral description
* No imagery
* No emotional language
Example:
ParenthoodScriptural references related to conception, birth, and the responsibilities of raising children.
No interpretation. No exhortation.

3.2 Canonical Distribution Overview (Optional but Powerful)
A small, subtle indicator:
This theme appears across:Smṛti · Itihāsa · Purāṇa · Dharmaśāstra
This helps users understand breadth without depth yet.

3.3 Curated Entry Points (Most Important Section)
This is the primary content of the theme page.
Display:
* 5–12 representative references
* Across multiple texts
* Ordered by canonical dignity, not popularity
Each entry shows:
* Text name
* Chapter / verse reference
* Short neutral descriptor (optional)
Example:
Manu-smṛti 3.56 — Duties of parents toward children

3.4 “Explore Further” Section (Collapsed by Default)
Below the curated list, a collapsible section:
View all references (47)
This protects the reader from overload.
Expansion is user-initiated, never automatic.

4. VISUAL TREATMENT (CRITICAL)
4.1 Visual Restraint Rules
Theme pages must:
* Use the same typography as reading pages
* Avoid cards, grids, or promotional blocks
* Avoid color differentiation beyond subtle separators
The theme page must feel like:
a scholarly appendix, not a homepage

4.2 No “Hero Sections”
Theme pages must never have:
* large banners
* inspirational imagery
* calls to action
They are maps, not sermons.

5. HOW THEMES APPEAR ON READING PAGES
5.1 Placement
Themes may appear on a Reading Page only:
* After the main content
* Or in a collapsed side panel
* Never above the scripture

5.2 Presentation Style
Themes appear as:
* simple text links
* understated typography
* neutral language
Example:
Related themes: Duty · Parenthood · Household Responsibility
No icons. No emphasis.

6. CROSS-THEME NAVIGATION (STRICTLY LIMITED)
6.1 Allowed
From a Theme Page, users may:
* click into a verse
* return to canonical text
* filter by text (optional)

6.2 Forbidden
Theme Pages must never:
* suggest other themes aggressively
* auto-chain into endless browsing
* behave like a recommendation engine
There is no infinite discovery loop.

7. DEPARTMENTS VS THEME PAGES (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)
Theme Pages:
* are neutral
* are non-guided
* expose raw references
Departments:
* are curated
* are pedagogical
* guide study
Theme Pages must never attempt to teach.

8. LIFE-CONTEXT VISIBILITY (SUBTLE, OPTIONAL)
If life-context is shown:
* It must be subtle
* Never visually dominant
* Never used to gate content
Example:
Commonly consulted by: Householders, Students
No personalization pressure.

9. WHAT THE USER SHOULD FEEL
After visiting a Theme Page, the user should feel:
* “I see where to look”
* “I can return to the text”
* “I am not lost”
* “Nothing is forcing me”
If a user feels:
* urgency
* overwhelm
* stimulation
The page has failed.

10. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This model prevents:
* Theme pages becoming blogs
* Discovery replacing reading
* Overlinked interfaces
* Endless browsing behavior
* UI-driven distraction

11. EVALUATION TEST (MANDATORY)
Every Theme Page must pass this test:
Could this page be printed as a scholarly index and still make sense?
If the answer is no, the page violates VKAD principles.

12. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
Themes should illuminate relationships,not demand exploration.
The reader must always feel:
“I am free to return to the text at any moment.”
