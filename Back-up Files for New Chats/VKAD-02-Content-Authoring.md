VKAD-02: CONTENT AUTHORING & COMMENTARY DISCIPLINE
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines how content is written, edited, expanded, and preserved within the VKAD system.
It governs:
* Verse authoring
* Translation ethics
* Commentary discipline
* Editorial restraint
* The difference between illumination and interference
If VKAD-01 defines what the canon is,VKAD-02 defines how humans may approach it.

1. AUTHORING PRINCIPLE (CORE AXIOM)
The author is a steward, not an owner.
No verse is “yours.”No translation is “final.”No commentary is “complete.”
Every act of writing is service to clarity, not self-expression.

2. THE VERSE FILE AS A SACRED UNIT
Each verse file is an Atomic Knowledge Unit (AKU).
An AKU must:
* Stand alone
* Be citeable
* Be intelligible without surrounding UI
* Preserve dignity even if printed on paper

3. CANONICAL VERSE FILE TEMPLATE (FINAL)
Every verse file must conform to this structure.
---
book: <Canonical text name>
chapter: <Number>
verse: <Number>
title: <Concise conceptual label>
commentary_author: <Traditional ācārya>
themes: [optional]
life_paths: [optional]
---

### Sanskrit

<Canonical Sanskrit text>

---

### Transliteration

<IAST transliteration>

---

### Translation

<Clear, dignified English translation>

---

### Commentary — <Ācārya Name>

<Traditional explanation>
Deviation from this template requires explicit justification.

4. SANSKRIT DISCIPLINE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
4.1 Source Integrity
* Sanskrit must come from recognized critical editions
* Diacritics must be preserved
* No “simplified Sanskrit”
* No modernization of orthography
If uncertain, leave Sanskrit unchanged rather than “improve” it.

4.2 No Interpretive Additions
The Sanskrit section:
* contains only the verse
* no gloss
* no punctuation beyond what is traditional
* no explanatory parentheses
Interpretation belongs elsewhere.

5. TRANSLITERATION ETHICS
5.1 Purpose
Transliteration exists to:
* support pronunciation
* assist non-Devanāgarī readers
* preserve phonetic integrity
It does not replace Sanskrit.

5.2 Rules
* Use standard IAST
* Do not simplify diacritics
* Maintain word boundaries as per traditional sandhi resolution
* One transliteration per verse (no alternates)

6. TRANSLATION DISCIPLINE (MOST SENSITIVE AREA)
6.1 Translation Is Interpretation
Every translation is:
* partial
* situated
* provisional
Therefore:
Translation must remain humble.

6.2 Translation Tone
A proper translation must be:
* Clear
* Literal where possible
* Conceptually faithful
* Free of modern moralizing language
* Free of devotional embellishment unless explicit in the verse

6.3 What Translation Must Avoid
* Psychological jargon
* Corporate / motivational language
* Political framing
* New-age reinterpretation
* Forced contemporization
The verse must speak before the translator does.

7. COMMENTARY DISCIPLINE (CRITICAL)
7.1 Commentary Is Secondary, Never Primary
Commentary exists to:
* clarify traditional understanding
* reveal philosophical structure
* contextualize difficult passages
It must never:
* replace the verse
* dominate the page
* override Sanskrit meaning

7.2 Attribution Is Mandatory
Every commentary must be explicitly attributed.
Examples:
* Śaṅkara
* Rāmānuja
* Madhva
* Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura
* Śrīla Prabhupāda (purports)
Anonymous commentary is not allowed.

7.3 Multiple Commentaries
If multiple bhāṣyas are included:
* Each must have its own clearly labeled section
* No synthetic “combined” commentary
* No editorial smoothing between schools
Difference is preserved, not erased.

8. MODERN EXPLANATION (OPTIONAL, TERTIARY)
Modern explanation may exist only if clearly separated.
If included:
* It must be labeled as Application or Contemporary Note
* It must never contradict traditional bhāṣya
* It must never appear before traditional commentary
Modern voice is a guest, not a resident.

9. THEMES & LIFE-PATH TAGGING (EDITORIAL OVERLAY)
9.1 Purpose
Tags exist to:
* help navigation
* support householders
* enable thematic study
They are not doctrinal claims.

9.2 Rules
* Tags must be sparse
* Prefer under-tagging to over-tagging
* Never invent themes unsupported by the verse
* Tags may evolve over time

10. EDITORIAL RESTRAINT RULES
10.1 When NOT to Write Commentary
Do not add commentary if:
* Traditional bhāṣya is unavailable
* The verse is self-explanatory
* Silence preserves dignity better than explanation
Absence of commentary is not a failure.

10.2 When to Revise
Revision is permitted only to:
* improve clarity
* correct errors
* refine language
Revision must never:
* change meaning
* introduce novelty
* follow trends

11. AUTHORSHIP HUMILITY CLAUSE
No contributor may:
* sign commentary with ego
* assert finality
* claim authority over the canon
All contributors act as:
temporary custodians of eternal texts

12. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This discipline prevents:
* Blog-style writing
* Opinion masquerading as śāstra
* Spiritualized self-help
* Commentary inflation
* Translator ego
If these appear, VKAD-02 has been violated.

13. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
The highest editorial virtue is restraint.
When in doubt:
* say less
* explain later
* preserve silence
Śāstra endures not because it is explained,but because it is left intact.
