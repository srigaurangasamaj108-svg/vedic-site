I am building a Vedic reading-first digital scripture platform using Astro + Markdown.
Core principles:
* One verse = one Markdown file (canonical unit)
* Sanskrit, transliteration, translation, commentary separated
* Reading page is primary; everything else is secondary
Structure:
* src/content/gita/chapter-{n}/verse-{m}.md
* Dynamic route: /gita/{chapter}/{verse}
* ReadingLayout with calm typography
* Verse navigation (prev/next)
Audiences (simultaneous):
1. Serious sādhaka (primary)
2. Householder applying dharma
3. Student / researcher
I do NOT want coding help unless strictly necessary.I want a VKAD (Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation) plan:
* Canon rules
* Content authoring discipline
* UI/reading doctrine
* Long-term rollout
Assume the technical foundation already works.Proceed as architect, not debugger.
