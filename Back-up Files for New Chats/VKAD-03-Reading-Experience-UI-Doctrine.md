VKAD-03: READING EXPERIENCE & UI DOCTRINE
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines the non-negotiable doctrine governing:
* Reading experience
* Typography
* Layout
* Interaction
* Interface behavior
* Visual restraint
It exists to ensure that technology never interferes with śāstra.
If VKAD-01 protects canonand VKAD-02 protects contentthen VKAD-03 protects the reader’s inner silence.

1. CORE DOCTRINE (SUPREME RULE)
The interface must disappear during reading.
If a reader becomes aware of:
* the design,
* the layout,
* the navigation,
* the features,
then the interface has failed.
A successful interface is unnoticed.

2. THE READING PAGE IS SACRED SPACE
2.1 The Reading Page Is the Primary Object
* The Reading Page is the center of the entire platform
* All other pages exist only to lead to it
* No feature may override, interrupt, or dominate it
The Reading Page is treated as:
a digital equivalent of an open śāstra on a desk

2.2 Single-Column Principle
* Reading content must always be:
    * single-column
    * centered
    * vertically flowing
* Multi-column layouts are forbidden for scripture text
Side panels (if any):
* must be collapsed by default
* must never reduce reading width

3. TYPOGRAPHY DOCTRINE (CRITICAL)
3.1 Typography Is Not Decoration
Typography exists to:
* slow the reader
* reduce fatigue
* preserve dignity
* encourage contemplation
It must never:
* excite
* dramatize
* entertain

3.2 Font Principles
* Serif fonts only for reading
* No display fonts for scripture
* No novelty fonts
* Font choice must feel book-like, not brand-like
Sans-serif fonts may be used only for:
* metadata
* UI controls
* navigation labels

3.3 Line Length & Rhythm
* Ideal line length: 60–70 characters
* Generous line-height (≈1.8–2.0)
* Ample margins on all sides
Cramped text is a violation of VKAD-03.

4. HIERARCHY & VISUAL SILENCE
4.1 Hierarchy Must Be Gentle
* Section headers must be:
    * small
    * restrained
    * never bold for emphasis
* No large typographic jumps
The eye should glide, not jump.

4.2 Sanskrit Treatment
* Sanskrit text must:
    * feel dignified
    * be visually distinct from commentary
    * never look like body prose
* Centered presentation is preferred
* No decorative styling
Sanskrit must feel older than the interface.

4.3 Commentary Subordination
* Commentary must be visually secondary
* It must never dominate the verse
* It must never appear louder than translation
If commentary attracts attention before the verse, the design is incorrect.

5. COLOR & MATERIAL DOCTRINE
5.1 Backgrounds
* Off-white / parchment tones only
* No pure white
* No dark black backgrounds by default
The background should feel:
like paper, not a screen

5.2 Contrast Discipline
* Soft contrast only
* No high-saturation colors
* No attention-grabbing highlights
Color exists to recede, not to speak.

6. INTERACTION DOCTRINE
6.1 No Interruptions
The following are strictly forbidden:
* Pop-ups
* Toasts
* Notifications
* Auto-expanding panels
* Infinite scroll
Reading must be finite, intentional, and bounded.

6.2 Motion Restraint
* No animations during reading
* No parallax
* No transitions that draw attention
If motion exists, it must:
* be subtle
* be optional
* be secondary to reading

6.3 Highlights & Notes
If highlighting is allowed:
* it must resemble pencil or ink
* it must not glow
* it must not animate
Digital highlighting must feel analog.

7. NAVIGATION DOCTRINE
7.1 Navigation Is Peripheral
Navigation elements must:
* stay at the edges
* be collapsible
* remain visually quiet
The reader must never feel “pulled away”.

7.2 Previous / Next Navigation
* Simple text links only
* No buttons
* No arrows that dominate
* Positioned after the content
Navigation supports continuity, not discovery.

8. HEADER & MENU BEHAVIOR
8.1 Header Auto-Withdrawal
* Headers must auto-hide during reading
* Reappear only on deliberate user action
* Never remain sticky by default
The page must feel alone with the reader.

8.2 Mega Menus (When Present)
* Must feel spacious
* Must never feel dense
* Must avoid overwhelming lists
Menus exist for orientation, not exploration.

9. MOBILE READING DOCTRINE
9.1 Mobile Is Not a Reduced Desktop
Mobile reading must be:
* single-column
* distraction-free
* thumb-respecting
* calm

9.2 Gestures Over Controls
* Swipes preferred over buttons
* Bottom sheets preferred over modals
* No tiny tap targets
Mobile reading should feel intimate, not crowded.

10. WHAT UI MUST NEVER DO
The interface must never:
* Compete with the text
* Explain the scripture visually
* Gamify learning
* Optimize for “engagement”
* Use metrics as design drivers
If a feature exists because “users like it”, it must be questioned.

11. EVALUATION TEST (MANDATORY)
Every UI decision must pass this test:
If this were printed on paper, would this element still be necessary?
If the answer is no, remove it.

12. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This doctrine prevents:
* App-ification of scripture
* Feed-driven consumption
* UI dominance over meaning
* Trend-following redesigns
* Attention economy intrusion

13. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
A sacred text does not need to be enhanced.It needs to be protected.
The highest UI achievement is:
a reader forgetting the interface exists.
