VKAD-09: DEPARTMENTAL CURATION DOCTRINE
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines:
* What a Department is (and is not)
* How departments are structured
* How departments relate to canon, themes, and life-paths
* How departments evolve without breaking anything
* How departments avoid becoming blogs, courses, or ideologies
Its core purpose:
To transform vast śāstric material into guided study pathswithout distorting scripture or overwhelming the reader.

1. WHAT A DEPARTMENT IS (STRICT DEFINITION)
A Department is a curated learning lens that arranges canonical textsand themes into a meaningful order for study.
A Department:
* does not add doctrine
* does not reinterpret scripture
* does not replace canon
* does not compete with themes
It guides attention, nothing more.

2. WHAT A DEPARTMENT IS NOT
A Department is not:
* a category
* a folder
* a tag
* a theme
* a course (though courses may later use departments)
Departments are editorial syllabi, not containers.

3. THE FOUR PILLARS OF A DEPARTMENT
Every department rests on four fixed pillars:
1. Canonical Scope
2. Thematic Emphasis
3. Life-Path Orientation
4. Study Progression
If any pillar is missing, the department is invalid.

4. CANONICAL SCOPE (PILLAR 1)
Each department must clearly declare:
* Which texts it draws from
* Which genres dominate (Śruti, Smṛti, Itihāsa, etc.)
* Which texts are primary vs supporting
Example:
Education & FormationPrimary: Smṛti, UpaniṣadsSupporting: Itihāsa, Purāṇa
This prevents:
* random aggregation
* hidden bias
* misrepresentation of sources

5. THEMATIC EMPHASIS (PILLAR 2)
Departments use themes, but do not redefine them.
Rules:
* A department may emphasize 5–10 themes
* Themes are referenced, not embedded
* Themes remain globally consistent
Example:
Department: Family & Social OrderEmphasized themes: Marriage, Parenthood, Duty, Harmony
Themes do not “belong” to departments.

6. LIFE-PATH ORIENTATION (PILLAR 3)
Each department must clearly state:
“For whom is this path most relevant?”
Allowed orientations:
* Students
* Householders
* Practitioners
* Renunciates
* Researchers
* Mixed (must be stated explicitly)
This is guidance, not restriction.
No content is gated.

7. STUDY PROGRESSION (PILLAR 4)
This is the heart of a department.
Departments must present content in intentional sequence:
1. Orientation texts (why this matters)
2. Foundational references
3. Deepening materials
4. Optional breadth readings
This is not chronology.It is pedagogical order.

8. DEPARTMENT PAGE STRUCTURE (CANONICAL UX)
Every Department Page must follow this structure:
8.1 Orientation Header
* Department name
* One-paragraph neutral description
* Intended life-paths
* Canonical scope summary
No motivational language.

8.2 Suggested Study Path (Primary Section)
A structured list such as:
* Step 1: Foundational references
* Step 2: Supporting texts
* Step 3: Deep study selections
* Step 4: Optional expansions
Each item links directly to canonical texts.

8.3 Thematic Cross-Links (Secondary)
A quiet list of relevant themes:
Related themes: Parenthood · Duty · Social Harmony
This invites exploration without pulling attention away.

8.4 Reference Materials (Optional)
* PDFs
* Charts
* Tables
* Traditional summaries
Clearly marked as reference, not core reading.

9. WHO CURATES DEPARTMENTS
Roles
* Department Curator
    * Maintains structure
    * Revises progression
    * Reviews additions
* Content Contributors
    * Suggest references
    * Cannot change structure
This prevents departments from drifting.

10. HOW DEPARTMENTS EVOLVE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Departments may evolve by:
* Adding new references
* Refining progression
* Clarifying scope
* Adjusting life-path guidance
Departments must never:
* change canonical interpretation
* override theme definitions
* fragment into sub-departments casually
If a department grows too large:
It must split only after formal review.

11. RELATIONSHIP TO COURSES (FUTURE-PROOFING)
Departments are pre-courses.
Later:
* Courses may reference departments
* Courses may add instruction
* Departments remain neutral and stable
This keeps your foundation intact even when monetization begins.

12. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This doctrine prevents:
* Departments becoming opinionated blogs
* Curriculum creep
* Redundant categorization
* Guru-centric distortion
* Unreviewed expansion

13. DEPARTMENT CREATION CHECKLIST
A department may be published only if:
* Canonical scope declared
* Themes selected (≤10)
* Life-path stated
* Study progression defined
* Neutral tone verified
If any item is missing → do not publish.

14. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
A Department is a path through the forest,not a fence around the trees.
It helps the seeker walkwithout telling them where they must go.
