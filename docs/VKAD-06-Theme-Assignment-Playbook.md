VKAD-06: THEME ASSIGNMENT PLAYBOOK
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines:
* How themes are assigned to content
* Who assigns them
* How many themes are allowed
* What to do when unsure
* How to prevent complexity explosion
Its goal is simple:
To make thematic tagging safe for non-programmers and non-scholars,while preserving intellectual integrity.

1. CORE EDITORIAL PRINCIPLE (MOST IMPORTANT)
Themes describe relevance, not meaning.
A theme answers:
“In what human context might this text be consulted?”
A theme does not answer:
* What the verse “really means”
* What doctrine it proves
* What conclusion the reader must draw
This principle alone prevents 80% of errors.

2. WHAT GETS TAGGED (AND WHAT DOES NOT)
2.1 Units Eligible for Theme Assignment
Themes may be assigned to:
* Individual verses
* Small verse groups (where inseparable)
* Sections or chapters
* Entire texts (sparingly)
* Reference PDFs (broadly)

2.2 Units That Must NOT Be Tagged
Themes must never be assigned to:
* Commentary opinions
* Editorial essays
* Homepage sections
* Marketing pages
Themes belong to scriptural content only.

3. WHO IS ALLOWED TO ASSIGN THEMES
Tiered Responsibility Model
Tier 1 — Core Editors
* Assign and revise themes freely
* Maintain taxonomy integrity
Tier 2 — Content Contributors
* Assign themes only from approved list
* Cannot create new themes
Tier 3 — Reviewers
* Suggest theme changes
* Cannot apply directly
This protects the system from drift.

4. THE GOLDEN RULE OF TAGGING (MEMORIZE THIS)
If a theme is not obvious from the text itself, do not assign it.
Do NOT assign themes based on:
* personal insight
* indirect interpretation
* later philosophical synthesis
Themes must be text-evident, not inferential.

5. HOW MANY THEMES PER CONTENT UNIT?
Hard Limits (Non-Negotiable)
* Minimum: 1 theme
* Ideal: 2–3 themes
* Maximum: 5 themes
If you feel tempted to add more:
You are compensating for uncertainty. Stop.
Under-tagging is always preferable to over-tagging.

6. THEME SELECTION PROCESS (STEP-BY-STEP)
When assigning themes, follow this exact sequence:
Step 1 — Identify the Human Question
Ask:
“Why would someone search for this?”
Not:
* “What does this verse philosophically support?”

Step 2 — Choose the Broadest Applicable Theme First
Always start at Level 2 themes, not sub-themes.
Example:
* Choose parenthood
* Not prenatal_rituals

Step 3 — Add a Second Theme Only if Distinct
Only add another theme if it answers a different human concern.
Example:
* parenthood
* ritual_observance

Step 4 — Stop Before Explanation Begins
The moment you feel the urge to explain why a theme applies, stop.
That means you’ve gone too far.

7. SUB-THEMES: WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO USE THEM
Allowed Only If ALL Conditions Are Met
* Theme is used across many texts
* Broad theme becomes too vague
* Users demonstrably search for specificity
Even then:
* Assign sub-theme in addition to, not instead of, the parent theme

8. LIFE-CONTEXT TAGGING (IMPORTANT DISTINCTION)
Life-context is not a theme.
It answers:
“Who is this most directly applicable to?”
Allowed Values (Example)
* child
* student
* householder
* renunciate
* practitioner
* researcher
Rules
* Maximum: 2 life-contexts per unit
* Optional
* Never mandatory
If unsure → omit.

9. WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE UNSURE
This is critical.
If unsure between two themes:
→ Choose the broader one.
If unsure whether to tag at all:
→ Do not tag.
If unsure because of interpretation:
→ Leave it to commentary, not theme.
Silence is acceptable.

10. ADDING A NEW THEME (RARE EVENT)
New themes are allowed only if:
* Repeated tagging pressure is observed
* Multiple editors request it
* Existing themes cannot reasonably cover it
New theme proposals must include:
* Proposed root domain
* Justification
* 3–5 example texts
No immediate approval.

11. THEME MAINTENANCE (HOW CHANGE HAPPENS SAFELY)
Themes may evolve by:
* Merging (preferred)
* Renaming labels (safe)
* Deprecation (never deletion)
Deprecation means:
“Do not use for new content.”
Old content remains intact.

12. WHAT THIS PLAYBOOK PREVENTS
This document prevents:
* Tag sprawl
* Editor ego
* Over-classification
* Inconsistent tagging
* Taxonomy drift
* Code fragility

13. DAILY EDITORIAL MANTRA
Canon first.Meaning later.Themes lightly.Silence respected.

14. FINAL PRINCIPLE
Themes exist to help the seeker find the text,not to tell the seeker what to think about it.
If this principle is honored, the system will remain calm forever.
