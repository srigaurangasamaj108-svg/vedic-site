VKAD-05: FORMAL THEME TAXONOMY & ONTOLOGY
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines:
* What a “theme” is (and is not)
* How themes are named
* How themes are grouped
* How themes may evolve safely
* How complexity is prevented
This document exists to ensure that thematic richness never collapses into chaos.

1. WHAT A THEME IS (STRICT DEFINITION)
A theme is a conceptual lens through which scripture may be read.
A theme:
* does NOT replace canon
* does NOT summarize scripture
* does NOT assert doctrine
It merely answers:
“What human concern does this text illuminate?”

2. WHAT A THEME IS NOT
A theme is not:
* a folder
* a department
* a life stage
* a belief
* a moral conclusion
Themes are descriptive, not prescriptive.

3. THEME ONTOLOGY (THREE LEVELS ONLY)
To prevent runaway complexity, VKAD allows only three levels.
LEVEL 1 — ROOT DOMAINS (STABLE)
These are never many and rarely change.
Approved Root Domains:
1. Dharma & Ethics
2. Life & Family
3. Education & Formation
4. Spiritual Practice
5. Philosophy & Knowledge
6. Health & Living
7. Society & Governance
8. Culture & Civilization
9. Renunciation & Liberation
These domains anchor meaning.

LEVEL 2 — THEMES (CORE WORK)
Themes live under a root domain.
Example under Life & Family:
* Marriage
* Parenthood
* Childbearing
* Household Duties
* Family Harmony
Themes are moderately stable but may grow.

LEVEL 3 — SUB-THEMES (OPTIONAL, SPARSE)
Used only when necessary.
Example under Parenthood:
* Conception
* Pregnancy
* Early Childhood
* Moral Formation
Sub-themes must be used sparingly.

4. THEME NAMING RULES (CRITICAL)
Themes must be:
* singular (not plural)
* noun-based (not sentences)
* culturally neutral
* timeless (not trendy)
Good
* parenthood
* detachment
* duty
* education
Bad
* how_to_raise_kids
* modern_parenting
* success_mindset

5. THEME IDENTIFIERS (TECHNICAL BUT SIMPLE)
Each theme has:
* a slug (used in code)
* a display name (shown to users)
Example:
slug: childbearing
label: Childbearing & Birth
root: life_and_family
Slugs are:
* lowercase
* underscore or hyphen
* stable
Labels may change without breaking anything.

6. HOW MANY THEMES ARE ALLOWED?
Hard limits (important):
* Root domains: 9 (fixed)
* Themes per domain: 10–20
* Sub-themes: only if unavoidable
Total ideal theme count:
80–120 themes maximum
This keeps the system human-scale.

7. THEME EVOLUTION RULES (YOUR FEAR ADDRESSED)
Themes may:
* be added
* be merged
* be renamed (label only)
* be deprecated
Themes must never:
* be deleted if in use (they are deprecated instead)
* override canonical structure
Deprecation simply means:
“Do not assign this theme to new content.”
Old content remains intact.

8. THEMES VS DEPARTMENTS (CLEAR DISTINCTION)
* Themes = conceptual lenses
* Departments = curated learning paths
A department may use:
* many themes
* many texts
* many life contexts
Themes never “belong” to departments.

9. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This taxonomy prevents:
* Tag explosion
* Synonym chaos
* Trend-driven labeling
* Repeated reorganization
* Code dependency on content

10. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
Themes must clarify, not classify excessively.
When in doubt:
* choose fewer themes
* choose broader meaning
* preserve discoverability without fragmentation
