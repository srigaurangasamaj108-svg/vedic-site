VKAD-08: SEARCH & DISCOVERY DOCTRINE
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document defines:
* How search functions within VKAD
* What search is allowed to surface
* What search must not do
* How discovery differs from recommendation
* How to preserve hierarchy, dignity, and silence
Its purpose is to ensure that:
Search assists intention,but never replaces contemplation.

1. CORE SEARCH PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Search responds to intent; it does not generate desire.
Search exists to help users who already know what they are looking for—or who can name a concern clearly.
Search must never:
* stimulate curiosity artificially
* push content
* behave like a feed
* optimize for engagement

2. SEARCH IS A TOOL, NOT A MODE
Search is not a browsing mode.
Users should never feel:
* “Let me explore endlessly”
* “Let me see what’s trending”
* “Let me discover more and more”
Search is entered deliberately and exited quickly.

3. SEARCH ENTRY POINT (UX DOCTRINE)
3.1 Invocation
* Search opens only when the user initiates it
* Prefer full-screen or focused overlay
* No persistent search bars on reading pages
Search must feel:
“I have stepped aside to look for something.”

3.2 No Suggestions Before Query
Search must not:
* auto-suggest content
* show popular searches
* show trending topics
Silence before intent.

4. SEARCH RESULT HIERARCHY (CRITICAL)
Search results must be ordered by meaning, not by match frequency.
Priority Order (Strict)
1. Canonical Scripture Units
    * Verses
    * Chapters
    * Sections
2. Theme Pages
    * Conceptual lenses
3. Departmental Paths
    * Curated guides
4. Reference PDFs
    * Clearly marked as reference
This hierarchy must never be violated.

5. SEARCH RESULT PRESENTATION
5.1 Result Cards (Minimal)
Each result shows:
* Text name
* Canonical reference
* One-line neutral descriptor
No images.No highlights.No promotional language.

5.2 No Infinite Scroll
Results must be:
* finite
* paginated
* clearly bounded
Endings matter.

6. FILTERS (APPLIED AFTER RESULTS ONLY)
Filters exist to refine, not to explore.
Allowed Filters
* Text / Canon
* Theme
* Life-context
* Department
Filters must:
* appear after initial results
* be optional
* never pre-empt the query

7. THEMATIC SEARCH (SUBTLE, NOT AGGRESSIVE)
When a query matches a theme:
* Show the theme as an option
* Do not redirect automatically
* Do not prioritize theme over verses
Example:
Theme related to your search: Parenthood
User chooses whether to follow.

8. LIFE-CONTEXT IN SEARCH (OPTIONAL, NEVER FORCED)
Life-context may be used to:
* annotate results
* suggest applicability
It must never:
* hide content
* gate access
* personalize aggressively
No algorithmic profiling.

9. WHAT SEARCH MUST NEVER DO
Search must never:
* Rank by popularity
* Rank by recent views
* Suggest “related content” endlessly
* Encourage binge reading
* Replace study paths
If search feels “smart,” it has failed.

10. PDF SEARCH RULES (STRICT)
* PDFs appear last
* Clearly marked as reference
* Never excerpted out of context
* Never treated as primary results
PDFs are consulted, not explored.

11. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This doctrine prevents:
* Search becoming a feed
* Algorithmic distortion of scripture
* Flattening of hierarchy
* Dopamine-driven exploration
* Loss of canonical dignity

12. EVALUATION TEST (MANDATORY)
Every search feature must pass this test:
Does this help a sincere seeker find a known concern faster,without encouraging distraction?
If the answer is no, the feature must be removed.

13. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
Search is a lamp, not a marketplace.
It illuminates what is soughtand then quietly steps away.
