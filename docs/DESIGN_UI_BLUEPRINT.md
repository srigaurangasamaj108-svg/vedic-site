IMPORTANT DESIGN INSTRUCTION:

This project is READING-FIRST.

The Reading Page is the PRIMARY OBJECT of DESIGN.
All other pages (homepage, menus, navigation) are SECONDARY and must visually and structurally support the Reading Page.

Design Sequence (MANDATORY):
1) First design the Reading Page UI in maximum detail (desktop first, then mobile).
2) Then derive the Mega Menu and Header so they feel light and non-intrusive.
3) Then design the Homepage as a quiet entry point, not a content showcase.

Evaluation Criteria:
A successful design is one where:
- The Reading Page feels calmer and more dignified than Scribd or Kindle.
- The user’s attention naturally stays on the text.
- UI elements disappear while reading.
- The interface feels respectful of sacred and classical literature.

If there is a tradeoff, ALWAYS choose:
Reading comfort > visual flair
Clarity > novelty
Silence > stimulation

==========================
Design a calm, timeless, library-grade digital reading platform inspired by sacred texts and long-form reading experiences (similar in clarity to Scribd, but more contemplative, minimal, and scholarly).

The platform is a Vedic knowledge library with three invisible structural layers:
1) Canonical scripture structure (Vedas, Smṛti, Itihāsa, Purāṇa, Āgama, Vedāṅga, Upaveda)
2) Human-readable themes (family life, education, spiritual practice, philosophy, health, culture)
3) User life-paths (parents, youth, seekers, practitioners, researchers)

VISUAL STYLE:
- Serene, respectful, book-like
- Off-white or parchment backgrounds
- Elegant serif typography for reading
- Soft contrast, no bright colors
- No modern “feed” or social-media look
- Minimal icons, subtle dividers
- Academic yet warm
- Avoid card-heavy layouts; prefer continuous, page-like surfaces for reading.

GLOBAL HEADER:
- Logo on left
- Menu items: Read | Explore Themes | Life Paths | Study Tools | Research | About
- Clean mega menus on hover/tap
- Header auto-hides on scroll

MEGA MENU DESIGN:
READ:
- Column 1: Śruti (Vedas), Smṛti, Itihāsa, Purāṇa, Āgama & Tantra, Vedāṅga, Upaveda
- Column 2: Sub-texts (e.g., Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, Atharva)
- Column 3: How to Read, Traditional Structure, Recommended Order
- Column 4: Continue Reading, Saved Texts, Recently Viewed


EXPLORE THEMES:
- Visual grid of theme groups:
  Childhood & Education
  Family & Life
  Spiritual Growth
  Philosophy & Knowledge
  Health & Living
  Ecology & Dharma
  Culture & Civilization

LIFE PATHS:
- For Parents
- For Youth & Students
- For Newly Married
- For Seekers
- For Practitioners
- For Researchers

READING PAGE (MOST IMPORTANT):
- Center-focused reading column
- Generous margins
- Book-like serif font
- Adjustable font size, line spacing, theme (light/sepia/dark)
- Sanskrit + Translation toggle
- Header minimal and collapsible
- Headings, verses, and commentary must be visually hierarchical but restrained, never decorative.


LEFT PANEL (collapsed by default):
- Chapter / verse navigation

RIGHT PANEL (collapsed by default, tabbed):
- Context (where this text fits traditionally)
- Commentary (traditional bhāṣyas)
- Themes (life relevance)
- Notes (user highlights)

INTERACTIONS:
- Highlights look like pencil/ink on paper
- Footnotes open in side panel
- Cross-references preview on hover
- No popups, no ads, no infinite scroll

MOBILE DESIGN:
- Single-column zen reading
- Bottom sheet panels for context/commentary
- Swipe gestures, no clutter

HOMEPAGE:
- Quiet, dignified
- Entry points via Themes and Life Paths
- No promotional noise

OVERALL FEEL:
- Timeless
- Scholarly
- Humane
- Sacred
- Designed for deep reading, not consumption

Create wireframes and high-fidelity UI concepts for:
1) Homepage
2) Mega Menu
3) Reading Page (desktop + mobile)


Create designs for both Desktop and Mobile views.

MEGA MENU INTERACTION RULES (IMPORTANT):

- In the READ mega menu, Column 2 must change dynamically based on hover/tap of Column 1 categories.
- Column 4 items (Continue Reading, Saved Texts, Recently Viewed) are visible only to logged-in users.
- Explore Themes must be presented as a visual grid of icon + title blocks, not as a text list, and must not display scripture names at this level.
- Global search opens as a full-screen overlay; filters appear only after a search query is entered, never before.
- Mega menus should feel spacious and breathable, never dense; if content exceeds visual comfort, prioritize clarity over completeness.
-  The READ mega menu should subtly emphasize continuity (resume, saved, recent) over discovery, without visual prominence.
