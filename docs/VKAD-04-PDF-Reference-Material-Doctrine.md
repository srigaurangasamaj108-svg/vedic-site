VKAD-04: PDF & REFERENCE MATERIAL DOCTRINE
Vedic Knowledge Architecture & Documentation

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
This document governs the use, placement, and limits of PDFs and other non-structured reference materials within the VKAD system.
Its purpose is to ensure that:
* Canonical scripture remains primary
* Structured text remains central
* PDFs remain supporting witnesses, not replacements
* The platform never degrades into a document dump (as seen in Scribd-like systems)
If VKAD-01 protects canon,VKAD-02 protects authorship,VKAD-03 protects reading silence,then VKAD-04 protects structural integrity against facsimile dominance.

1. CORE AXIOM (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
PDFs are references, not reading destinations.
No PDF may ever:
* replace a canonical reading page
* become the default mode of reading scripture
* override structured text in prominence or authority
If a PDF becomes primary, VKAD-04 has been violated.

2. CLASSIFICATION OF PDF MATERIAL
All PDFs must be classified into one of the following categories.
2.1 Canonical Facsimiles
Examples:
* Scanned manuscripts
* Critical editions
* Original Devanāgarī prints
Purpose:
* Verification
* Scholarly reference
* Source authentication
They do not define reading flow.

2.2 Traditional Commentaries (Undigitized)
Examples:
* Bhāṣyas not yet transcribed
* Rare regional editions
* Historical printings
Purpose:
* Reference for editors
* Advanced scholars
* Future transcription
They are secondary to digitized commentary.

2.3 Research & Auxiliary Material
Examples:
* Academic papers
* Comparative studies
* Philological notes
Purpose:
* Deep research only
* Never part of normal reading

3. STORAGE DOCTRINE FOR PDFs
3.1 PDFs Are Binary Artifacts
PDFs must be stored as-is and never altered.
Canonical location:
public/pdfs/
  {text-name}/
    {descriptor}.pdf
Example:
public/pdfs/gita/shankara-bhashya-critical.pdf
PDFs must never be stored inside src/content.

3.2 Naming Discipline
PDF filenames must be:
* descriptive
* stable
* human-readable
* free of version noise
Avoid:
* dates
* upload timestamps
* vague names like scan1.pdf

4. UI PRESENTATION RULES (CRITICAL)
4.1 PDFs Must Never Be Default
On any verse or chapter page:
* PDF links must be optional
* visually quiet
* secondary in hierarchy
Acceptable phrasing:
* “View scanned edition (PDF)”
* “Reference: Śaṅkara Bhāṣya (PDF)”
Unacceptable:
* auto-opening PDFs
* embedding PDFs by default
* replacing text with PDF viewer

4.2 Visual Containment
When PDFs are opened:
* They must appear in a contained view
* Prefer overlays or separate pages
* Never hijack navigation
The reader must always feel:
“I chose to consult this.”

5. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PDF AND CANON
5.1 Canon Always Comes First
The reading order is always:
1. Sanskrit (structured)
2. Transliteration
3. Translation
4. Traditional commentary
5. PDF reference (optional)
PDFs must never interrupt this order.

5.2 PDF as Witness, Not Authority
PDFs:
* confirm
* preserve
* document
They do not interpret.
Interpretation belongs to structured commentary.

6. SEARCH & DISCOVERY RULES
6.1 PDFs Are Not Primary Search Targets
Search results must prioritize:
* verses
* themes
* concepts
PDFs may appear:
* only after structured results
* clearly marked as reference material

6.2 No PDF-First Navigation
Users must never be encouraged to:
* browse PDFs directly
* explore content via PDFs
* discover scripture through scans
Discovery flows through canon, not facsimiles.

7. PDF READING EXPERIENCE (RESTRAINT DOCTRINE)
7.1 Minimal Viewer Only
If PDFs are embedded:
* no annotations by default
* no toolbars dominating view
* no infinite scroll UI overlays
The PDF viewer must be dumb and quiet.

7.2 No Feature Arms Race
Do not add:
* highlighting systems
* social notes
* collaborative comments
* progress gamification
PDF interaction must remain primitive by design.

8. WHEN TO DIGITIZE INSTEAD OF LINKING PDFs
PDFs should be replaced by structured text when:
* the text becomes central to study
* commentary is repeatedly referenced
* verses are frequently cited
* translation is required
Digitization always supersedes PDF reliance.

9. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCUMENT PREVENTS
This doctrine prevents:
* Scribd-style consumption
* PDF hoarding
* UI domination by viewers
* Scans replacing reading
* Structural decay into file hosting
If the platform starts “feeling like a PDF site,” VKAD-04 has failed.

10. EDITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Editors must:
* decide when a PDF is necessary
* resist uploading PDFs unnecessarily
* prioritize transcription over storage
* remove PDFs when structured text becomes available
Restraint is an editorial virtue.

11. EVALUATION TEST (MANDATORY)
Every PDF must pass this test:
If this PDF were removed, would the reading experience still be complete?
If the answer is no, the PDF has violated VKAD principles.

12. CLOSING PRINCIPLE
PDFs preserve history.Structured text preserves understanding.
Your platform exists to cultivate understanding, not to archive files.
PDFs are welcome —but they must always bow to the canon.
