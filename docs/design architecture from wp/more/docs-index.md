# Documents Index (What exists + what is downloadable)

## Downloadable “Generated files” (you saw these 3)
1) quick-action-summary.md
2) guidelines-comparison-detailed.md
3) claude-prompts-week1.md

## Newly exported (downloadable) in this message
4) exec-summary.md
5) impl-checklist.md
6) docs-index.md (this file)

## Optional extra (if you want a longer deep-dive)
- guidelines-analysis.md (a medium-depth analysis)

## Why the earlier 3-only issue happened
Only files created via the export mechanism appear as download cards.
Other notes may exist in the workspace internally but do not show unless exported.

## What to do if any file still doesn’t appear
1) Refresh the thread view.
2) Check the “Files / Generated” panel.
3) If still missing, tell which filenames are not visible and they will be re-exported.
